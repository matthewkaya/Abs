"""Sprint 2K — create the abs_admin Postgres role that owns BYPASSRLS.

Revision ID: 0015b_abs_admin_role
Revises: 0015_rls_audit_tables
Create Date: 2026-05-14

Production deploy notes — ``docs/operations/rls-admin-bypass.md`` — go
into the GRANT and DSN switch the founder runs once on the Hetzner
cluster. This migration *only* creates the role so the application's
schema is self-describing and matches infra-as-code.

The role is created with ``NOLOGIN`` by default. The founder grants
login + connect access during deploy; before that the role exists but
nothing can authenticate as it, which keeps an unfinished prod deploy
safe from inadvertent admin connections.

SQLite path: skip — there is no role concept.
