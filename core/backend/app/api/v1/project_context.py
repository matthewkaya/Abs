"""Active-project resolution (multi-tenant Phase 1, B4).

A user can belong to multiple projects; the active one is selected per request
via the ``X-Project-Id`` header. This helper resolves + authorizes it:

  * header absent            → None (tenant-wide behaviour, unchanged/legacy)
  * project not in tenant    → 404
  * caller not a member      → 403  (admins bypass membership within their tenant)

When a project is active, RAG ingest stamps ``project_id`` into the chunk
payload and query adds a ``project_id`` filter, giving per-project isolation
ADDITIVELY — documents ingested without a project keep working under plain
tenant scoping (no migration of the live corpus required).
