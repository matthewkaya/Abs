"""Bearer-token enforcement for the /mcp streamable-HTTP transport.

The FastMCP streamable-http app ships no authentication of its own, and the
``abs_mcp_`` tokens minted by ``POST /v1/mcp/tokens`` were never wired into
the transport — so any caller that passed the Host allowlist could list and
call all tools without a credential, spending the operator's provider keys.

This is a *pure ASGI* middleware (NOT Starlette ``BaseHTTPMiddleware``): the
MCP transport streams responses (SSE), and BaseHTTPMiddleware buffers the body
which would break the stream. We only inspect request headers before handing
off to the inner app, so streaming is untouched.

Enforcement is gated by ``settings.mcp_auth_enforce`` (default True). When the
header is missing or ``verify_token`` rejects it, we return a JSON-RPC-shaped
401 without ever touching the FastMCP session manager.
