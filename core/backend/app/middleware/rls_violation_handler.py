"""Sprint 2K — convert Postgres RLS violations to a typed 403 response.

When the tenant GUC is missing or wrong at write time, Postgres raises
``new row violates row-level security policy`` (SQLSTATE 42501,
``InsufficientPrivilege``). Left uncaught that bubbles up to FastAPI's
default 500 path and the client sees an unhelpful "internal server
error" while the operator scans logs for a database crash.

This handler intercepts those errors and re-raises them as a clean
``403 tenant_isolation_required``. Read-side leaks are *already*
prevented (the policy silently filters rows) — this handler is the
write-side complement.
