"""S20.3 — feature_usage 29-ID catalog + tenant aggregation service.

29 feature IDs are the immutable "what we measure" registry. Adding a new
feature requires a code change here AND a release note (so it shows up in
analytics dashboards and per-tier quota plans).

Aggregation: SQLite has no materialized views, so `get_usage()` runs a
GROUP BY at query time. For self-host deployments (<= 1M rows) this is
sub-millisecond; if a tenant outgrows it, the aggregation can be moved to a
periodic snapshot table without changing the public API.
