"""Sprint 2E ITEM-C — Lighthouse slow-3g config sanity.

Pre-2E the slow-3g LHCI profile used `preset: "perf"`, which tells
Lighthouse to run only the performance audits. But the assertion block
still asserts `categories:accessibility` (error gate) — that category
never executes under `preset: perf`, so LHCI emits
`categories.accessibility failure for auditRan assertion` and the job
goes red.

The fix is to drop the preset and explicitly list `onlyCategories`
including accessibility + best-practices. These tests lock in the
correctness of the config so a future drift puts the gate back red
immediately on PR rather than on the next nightly cron.
