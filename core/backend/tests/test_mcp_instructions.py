"""MCP server ships delegation instructions over `initialize`.

Connecting clients (Claude Code, Codex, …) receive `instructions` in the MCP
initialize response, so the "delegate substantial subtasks to ABS" behaviour
is turnkey from the server — no client-side CLAUDE.md required for the basics.
This pins that the instructions exist and name the headline delegation tools.
