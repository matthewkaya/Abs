"""Q12 L21 sweep 3 — destructive fresh-deploy drill spec (founder-gated).

Sweep 3 of L21 was always going to be founder-gated because it
deletes Docker volumes and rebuilds from clean. This file ships the
*spec* — assertions that the script exists, has the safety gate,
and SKIP path is the default — without running the destructive
part.

The actual drill runs only when ABS_DESTRUCTIVE_DRILL=1 is set, which
the founder does locally before each prod rollout cut.
