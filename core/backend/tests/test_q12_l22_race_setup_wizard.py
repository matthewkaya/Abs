"""Q12 Round 15 / L22 — race condition deep: setup wizard TOCTOU.

Closes Q12-L22-001 (HIGH installation-phase data corruption):
`/v1/setup/step/admin` (and the other step endpoints) follow the
classic TOCTOU pattern:

  state = read_state()                 # ← non-locking JSON read
  _ensure_step(state, expected_step)   # ← check
  # ... do work, mutate state ...      # ← race window (microseconds)
  _atomic_write_state(state)           # ← non-locking JSON write

Two concurrent admins POSTing to /step/admin both see the same
`current_step=1`, both pass `_ensure_step`, both write
`admin_credentials.json` (last writer wins on disk), both call
`_advance` and `_atomic_write_state` (last writer wins on disk).

Result pre-fix: BOTH return HTTP 200, with `admin_credentials.json`
silently containing whichever email was written last. The losing
admin has NO indication their credentials were overwritten.

Real-world scenario: KOBİ pilot install where co-founders open the
setup URL on two tabs, click through the wizard at the same time.
Co-founder A's credentials are silently dropped; co-founder B can
log in but A is locked out — no error message either side.

Fix: wrap read-modify-write in an exclusive file-lock
(`fcntl.LOCK_EX` on a companion `.lock` file). One request enters
the critical section at a time. The losing call observes the
already-advanced state on its read and returns HTTP 409 from
`_ensure_step`, surfacing the conflict.

This is the canonical solution: works for multi-worker uvicorn
(several processes), no in-process state, simple and audited.
