"""
Q12-L30 R79 — fs-scan P0 allowlist coverage contract.

We don't run fs-scan from inside pytest (it's an MCP tool, not a Python
package), but we do lock the contract that every documented P0 source path
in the repository is either:

  (a) covered by an allowlist entry in .fs-scan-allowlist.yaml, OR
  (b) a real bug we have not yet fixed (in which case this test FAILS so we
      cannot land additional P0s without an explicit allowlist + review).

The list of "currently flagged P0 source paths" is captured at R79 time —
the test reads .fs-scan-allowlist.yaml and asserts each captured path
appears in the `files` field of some allowlist entry.

If a future P0 lands at a new path, the worker MUST either:
  - fix the underlying issue (so fs-scan stops flagging the path), or
  - extend the allowlist with a why explaining the false positive

Either way, the contract makes sure no silent P0 backlog accumulates.
