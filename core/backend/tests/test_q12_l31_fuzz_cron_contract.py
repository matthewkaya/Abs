"""
Q12-L31 R80 — weekend fuzz cron workflow contract.

The 30K Hypothesis fuzz (chat + RAG + workflows × 10K each) lives behind
the `[fuzz]` pytest marker that PR CI default-skips and the
`mutation-weekend.yml` workflow runs every Saturday 02:00 UTC.

R80 reviewed the cron output (no counterexamples surfaced — `.hypothesis/`
holds no `examples/` directory locally, and the local 30K run finishes
cleanly). The risk a regression test guards against here is *the cron
silently breaking*: someone reformats `mutation-weekend.yml`, drops the
`fuzz-30k` job, or removes the `-m fuzz` selector — and the Saturday
window quietly stops running for weeks.

This test asserts:
  1. The workflow file still exists and parses as YAML.
  2. The Saturday cron is still wired (`schedule.cron == 0 2 * * SAT`).
  3. The `fuzz-30k` job exists and pins the test file + `[fuzz]` marker.
  4. The on-failure `Upload Hypothesis-DB` step still uploads the
     `.hypothesis/` directory so a future review has the artifact to read.
  5. The fuzz pytest file the cron points at exists and has the
     `[fuzz]` marker on its test classes / functions.
