"""
Q12-L32 R82 — Lighthouse nightly workflow stability contract.

Locks the rewrite from R82 — prior workflow targeted unreachable
`https://abs.local/` and the nightly was silently broken for the entire
existence of the repo. This regression pin ensures:

  1. The nightly never points at unreachable hostnames again.
  2. Both desktop + slow-3G jobs exist and reference the canonical
     lighthouserc files (so a single edit to the assertion thresholds
     propagates without ambiguity).
  3. The desktop job retries exactly once on failure.
  4. Both jobs upload artifacts so a failed nightly is reviewable.
  5. The slow-3G lighthouserc declares its mobile + throttling profile
     (no PR-time refactor can silently demote it to desktop).
