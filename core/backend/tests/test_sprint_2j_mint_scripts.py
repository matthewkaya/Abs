"""Sprint 2J FAZ E — guardrails for mint_and_email.sh + customer_onboard.sh.

These two shell scripts are the only path a customer's license JWT
travels through, so a silent regression (e.g. someone removes
`--dry-run`, or the JTI grep stops matching the JWT payload) would
break Pilot Batch 1 broadcast before anyone notices. The FAZ A
preflight log shows the `--dry-run` flag was used as recently as
2026-05-09; this test ensures it stays wired even after future
refactors.

What we assert:

* `scripts/mint_and_email.sh` accepts and advertises `--dry-run`
  alongside its three required positional arguments, and the
  POST-side bypass still routes through `https://api.resend.com/emails`
  (so a typo on the Resend host can't slip past code review).
* `scripts/customer_onboard.sh` materialises a JWT with a
  base64-decodable middle segment whose payload contains the four
  claims the operator playbook documents: `customer_id`, `tier`,
  `seat_count`, and `jti`. No live network call required — the
  script runs synchronously and writes `customer-keys/<slug>/license.jwt`.
