"""Non-working-feature round — a `loop` node must NOT masquerade as success.

The linear v1 engine cannot iterate. Previously a `loop` node returned a silent
`{"skipped": "loop"}` and the run finished as a clean `done`, so a workflow built
from the shipped "Each supplier" template (templates.py) reported success while
the loop body ran ZERO times — it notified nobody. This pins the honest
behaviour: the loop node surfaces an explicit `unsupported` error and the run
records a visible `warnings` entry, so the gap is reported rather than hidden.
Real iteration is the durable-engine follow-up.
